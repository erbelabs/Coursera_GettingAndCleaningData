This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data (course project week 3)

### Analysis process

The [analysis script](run_analysis.R) process is as follows:
- Download the experiment data
- Read the test and train data and stored in these variables (X_test, y_test, X_train, y_train)
- Since it is required to extract only the mean and std feature, we replace those variables using filter.
- We add the second column for y_test and y_train variable with the activity_label by taking the value of the first column as its index
- We merge the test and train data afterwards and stored in variable merge_data.
- The tidy_data is then created and written to a file `tidy_data.txt`.
- There are short comments in the `run_analysis.R` file, explaining each action performed. This should be helpful to understand each process.

### The output file

The `tidy_data.txt` file contains the following columns:
 [1] "SUBJECT"                        
 [2] "ACTIVITY_LABEL"                 

The following columns (starting from the third) is the mean of the recorded data for the given subject and activity pair. The name refers to the features.txt file.
